            <img src="images/slider-1-au.jpg"/>            
            <h4>STRATEGY/SOCIAL MEDIA/WEB DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> HealthTeacher had just finished developing a cool app to 
            teach kids how to stand up to bullies. They also had the perfect opportunity 
            to garner attention with Anti-Bullying Awareness Month.  But they had to move 
            fast to make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Effectively promote the AwesomeUpstander! app via social 
            media to augment other marketing and public relations activities. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong> GmG quickly developed a highly targeted strategy aimed at 
            prominent mom bloggers and created a social campaign that launched just 
            in time for Anti-Bullying Awareness Month. Creating a community hub and 
            securing participation from more than a dozen national mom bloggers, our 
            team exposed more than 150,000 moms to HealthTeacher’s anti-bullying app 
            and educational materials during the month of October.

            <h4>CONTENT DEVELOPMENT/STRATEGY/SALES SUPPORT/CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> In response to a rapidly changing landscape in accountable care, 
              Premier, Inc. had developed an amazing portfolio of resources and consulting services 
              that were available to members of its various collaboratives. Over time, the organization 
              realized that its members were not fully aware of all it had to offer.              
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Expertly package and position Premier’s deep expertise and resources 
              for helping hospitals and health systems prepare for accountable care.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong> GmG worked closely with Premier’s internal communications team and 
              subject matter experts to reshape its promotional collateral for its accountable care offerings. 
              The new collateral is helping Premier representatives tell their story and effectively consult 
              with their membership.

            <img src="images/portfolio-slider-3.jpg"/>            
            <h4>STRATEGY/CUSTOMER LOYALTY/BRANDING</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> Against the Grain is a nonprofit that lives up to its name. 
              When other charities were making a push for end of year donations in 2012, AtG was doing something a little different. Purchasing a 
              pizza joint. The charity bought Brothers Pizza Co. to help augment 
              their revenue sources and to provide job training for people who need 
              help getting back on their feet.             
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Help AtG develop a strategic marketing plan to help 
              them increase revenue of the restaurant by 20% in 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong> GmG has been working with Brothers to develop an 
              integrated strategy that focuses heavily on customer loyalty, local 
              partnerships and rebranding efforts. Among the activities planned for 
              2013 are a grand re-opening, an increased presence on social media, 
              more systemic and consistent communications, diversification of revenue 
              sources and enhancements to the overall customer experience.

            <img src="images/portfolio-slider-4.jpg"/>            
            <h4>SALES SUPPORT/LEAD GENERATION/INTEGRATED CAMPAIGN</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> Healthways needed to fill its sales pipeline amidst a violently 
              competitive marketplace. Standing out from the crowd was a problem, as 
              was engaging potential customers who had grown skeptical of wellness 
              vendors.         
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Launch an effective lead generation campaign that would 
              drive significant activity in the sales pipeline, translating in new revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong>  While other firms were using vivid lifestyle imagery and flowery, 
              aspirational language, our Change the Facts campaign delivered a bare bones 
              approach that cut to the chase. The health statistics were scary. Healthways 
              could change them. And we had hard proof. Change the Facts funneled more 
              than $35 million of prospective revenue into the pipeline and helped convert 
              $10 million into won revenue.

            <h4>BRANDING/IDENTITY/STRATEGY/WEBSITE</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> Privia was bracing for rapid growth but was being challenged 
              by messaging that didn’t fully articulate the innovation and value of its products.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> To develop a new messaging platform that clearly articulated the 
              Privia value proposition to a range of audiences (physicians, patients, investors, 
              partners) and refresh the company’s main branding vehicles, including 
              corporate website, consumer-facing materials, video assets and sales collateral.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong>  Strategic messaging workshops, consumer and physician feedback 
              and competitive audits helped us form a clear and compelling messaging platform. 
              We fully executed a suite of new creative assets that have been effective in 
              repositioning the company for growth. For a sample of the new messaging and 
              visuals, please visit http://www.priviahealth.com.

            <h4>CONSUMER MARKETING/WELLNESS ENGAGEMENT</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> A series of acquisitions left Healthways with a disjointed 
              and unorganized approach to offering clients marketing solutions to drive 
              participation in the company’s wellness programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Establish marketing engagement team to consult with clients, 
              build effective marketing strategies and develop integrated marketing campaign 
              to drive participation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong> Formed team, oversaw creation of unified marketing campaign 
              covering all Healthways programs, developed communications consulting and 
              account management best practices. Served 150 Healthways clients in first year 
              of operation. Survey responses and statistics demonstrated engagement levels 
              more than doubled when engagement team was active with accounts.  
              Campaigns have won multiple industry awards for innovation and effectiveness.

            <img src="images/portfolio-slider-7.jpg"/>            
            <h4>STRATEGIC PLANNING/ANALYSIS/MARKET RESEARCH</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>SITUATION:</strong> Privia Health wanted to more effectively and efficiently drive 
              membership in its wellness and prevention programs, which are made available 
              through partnerships with primary care physicians.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Conduct a full analysis of current Privia membership and develop 
              a strategic plan to address opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>RESPONSE:</strong> Conducted full analysis of membership lifecycle. Completed 
              in-depth review of process for program introduction, led segmentation project 
              to better understand key demographic/psychographic characteristics of members 
              and uncovered drivers for buying decisions and emotional barriers to membership. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Analysis resulted in a streamlined program launch process, targeted messaging 
              based on segmentation/barriers and the introduction of multiple new programs and
              tactics that were piloted to drive additional membership.

            <p>
              <strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Design and implement a web prescence that more
